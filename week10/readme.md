Part 1:<br>
Understanding RNN<br>
Question: What are Recurrent Neural Networks, and how do they differ from traditional feedforward neural networks?<br>
Task: Explain the working of RNN, and how information is passed through the network over time.<br>
Stacking RNN Layers and Bi-directional Architecture<br>
Question: Discuss the advantages and potential drawbacks of stacking RNN layers. What are Bi-directional RNNs, and how do they enhance the performance of sequence models?<br>
Task: Explains when and why you would use stacked RNN layers and bi-directional RNNs in a sequence modeling task.
Hybrid Architecture<br>
Question: What is a hybrid architecture in the context of sequence modeling? <br>Provide examples of how combining RNNs with other deep learning models can enhance performance.<br>
Types of RNN:<br>
Question: List down types of RNN model and explain their structures and differences with RNN.<br>
Part 2: <br>
Implementing a Basic RNN Model<br>
Task: Using a dataset of your choice (e.g., text, time-series data), implement a basic RNN model. <br>Train the model to perform a sequence task such as text generation, sentiment analysis, or time-series prediction.<br>
Deliverable: Perform this experimentation in a notebook and provide a detailed explanation or comments.<br>
Stacking RNN Layers and Bi-directional RNNs<br>
Task: Modify your basic RNN model by stacking multiple RNN layers and also converting it into a bi-directional RNN. <br>Analyze the performance improvement (if any) compared to the basic RNN model. (Note: Separate Implementation of Stacked RNN &  Bi-Directional RNN)<br>
Deliverable: Perform this experimentation in a notebook and provide a detailed explanation or comments.<br>
Exploring Hybrid Architectures<br>
Task: Implement a hybrid architecture by combining your RNN model with another model (e.g., CNN, Attention mechanism).<br> Train this hybrid model on the same dataset and compare its performance with the previous models.<br>
Deliverable:<br> Submit the Python code in a notebook for the hybrid model along with a report discussing the results, challenges faced, and the benefits (or drawbacks) of using a hybrid approach.
