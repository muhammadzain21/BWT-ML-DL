Tasks 1:
1. Define a class `Book` with attributes `title`, `author`, and `pages`. Include methods to get and set these attributes.
2. Create an instance of `Book` and demonstrate the use of getter and setter methods.
3. Implement a class method in the Book that calculates the reading time based on an assumed reading speed (e.g., 250 words per minute).
4. Implement inheritance by creating a subclass `Ebook` that inherits from `Book` and adds an attribute `format`. Override the `__str__()` method to display all attributes.

Task 4
1. Create an iterator class `Countdown` that counts down from a given number to 1.
2. Implement a generator function `fibonacci_generator` that yields Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
3. Implement a generator function random_number_generator that yields a sequence of random numbers between a specified range.
4. Write a Python program that uses the `Countdown` iterator, `fibonacci_generator` and random_number_generator  to demonstrate their usage.
