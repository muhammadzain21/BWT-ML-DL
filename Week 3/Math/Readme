Task3:
1. Design a Python package named `math` that includes modules for basic arithmetic operations (`addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`, `modulus`) with some advance mathematical operations such as exponentiation and square root.
2. Implement functions within each module to perform respective operations.
3. Create a main script (`main.py`) outside the package to demonstrate importing and using functions from the `math` package.
Instructions:
1.Directory Structure: Create a folder named math_package and inside it, create another folder named mymath. Inside the mymath folder, create the Python modules as specified.
2.main.py: Place this script in the math_package folder, outside the mymath directory.
3.Run the main.py script: This script demonstrates the use of the package, with error handling for division by zero and square roots of negative numbers.
