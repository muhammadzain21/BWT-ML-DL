Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Assignment - Month 3 Week 1<br>>
Overview<br>
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for the Month 3 Week 1 assignment focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).<br> The tasks include studying CNN architecture, implementing CNNs on the MNIST and Cat-vs-Dog datasets, and exploring the use of callbacks to optimize model training.

Objectives
Understand the architecture and components of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Learn about convolutional and pooling layers and their role in feature extraction.
Compare CNN performance with that of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the MNIST dataset.
Implement CNNs on the MNIST and Cat-vs-Dog datasets.
Utilize callbacks (e.g., EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint) to improve model training.
