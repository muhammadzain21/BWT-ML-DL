This assignment aims to utilize given datasets for both classification and regression tasks.<br> The students will start by cleaning and analyzing the data using Numpy and Pandas, followed by visualizing the data using Matplotlib. They will then apply 2 to 3 different machine learning models for classification datasets only and evaluate the models' performance.
Datasets:
1. Classification Dataset: `weather_classification_data.csv`
2. Regression Dataset: `pakwheels_used_cars.csv`

Note: You need to apply Preprocessing steps on both dataset but just has to write code for classification models only.
